This project provides a visually rich, data-driven analysis of the 2018 Kerala floods, leveraging multiple datasets to explore climate risk and disaster management. The notebook features advanced visualizations, including value and correlation heatmaps, to reveal the impact of the floods across Kerala's districts.


## 📁 Datasets
- **warnings_actual_predicted.csv** — Actual and predicted rainfall warnings (Kaggle)
- **district_wise_details.csv** — District-level flood impact metrics (fatalities, rainfall, landslides, damaged houses, etc.)


## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. **Place both datasets** (`warnings_actual_predicted.csv` and `district_wise_details.csv`) in the project folder.
3. **Open and run the notebook:**
   - `flood_risk_analysis_kerala_2018.ipynb`


## 📊 Features & Visualizations
- Data exploration: shape, info, summary, missing values
- District-wise rainfall visualization
- Heatmap of casualties and warnings (if present)
- **District-wise Value Heatmap:**
   - Visualizes flood impact metrics (fatalities, rainfall, landslides, damaged houses, etc.) for each district
- **Correlation Heatmap:**
   - Shows relationships between all district-level flood impact metrics
